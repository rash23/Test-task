This project was created using the following technologies: React, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS and a bit of Vanilla JavaScript.
A lot of attention was paid to Redux Toolkit because I wanted to show my knowledge of this technology.

If you want to see the result of my work you can use the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/rash23/Test-task.git
2. npm run dev

Also you can see the result from this link:
