This project was created using the following technologies: React, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
Much attention was paid to Redux Toolkit because I wanted to show my knowledge of this technology.
There are still some low-priority bugs in the page layout, but I hope that in this case, this is not the most important thing.
Also, I decided not to style the checkbox because it would be difficult without some UI library or framework.

If you want to see the result of my work you can use the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/rash23/Test-task.git
2. npm run dev

Also you can see the result from this link: https://react-technical-assessment-two.vercel.app/
